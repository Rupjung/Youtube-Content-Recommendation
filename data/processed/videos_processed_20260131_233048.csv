jOF0Fd7aKqk,"Israeli air strikes kill at least 28 Palestinians in Gaza, rescue officials say | BBC News","At least 28 people have been killed in a wave of Israeli air strikes across the Gaza Strip on Saturday, according to local authorities.

The civil defence agency, which is operated by Hamas, says children and women were among those killed. It added that in one attack, helicopter gunships hit a tent sheltering displaced people in the southern city of Khan Younis.

Palestinians have described these strikes as the heaviest since the second phase of the ceasefire, brokered by President Trump in October, came into effect earlier this month.

The Israeli military confirmed that a number of strikes were carried out in response to what it said was a Hamas violation of the agreement on Friday.

Both Israel and Hamas have accused each other of violating the truce since it came into effect last year.

Fm7DZlL5FOM,Can Trump really save the midterms for the Republicans? | BBC Americast,"Can Republicans win the midterm elections and keep control of both houses of Congress? 

It’s the biggest political event of the year, and this week Donald Trump kicked off the Republican’s campaign in Iowa, telling voters the odds are against him, but Republicans “need to win”.  

The president’s chief of staff says this is just the start, and Trump will be campaigning for the midterms as if it were a presidential race because he’s good at driving voter turnout.  

In this episode, Sarah and Anthony discuss why the midterm elections matter, what the stakes are, and Republican chances of winning.  

They’re joined by a former campaign adviser to Donald Trump, Bryan Lanza, who sets out why ICE immigration protests and worries over the economy shouldn’t stop a Republican victory.

We also hear from Mary in Kentucky as we build our own “United States of Americast”, finding Americasters in every US state.  

Listen out for what you might not already know about Kentucky.

nuQYg5yt3bM,Donald Trump nominates Federal Reserve critic Kevin Warsh to run US central bank | BBC News,"US President Donald Trump has nominated conservative economist Kevin Warsh as the new chair of the US Federal Reserve.

The 55-year-old, who served as a Fed governor from 2006 to 2011, is an outspoken critic of the central bank, which has been under political pressure from the White House about how it sets interest rates.

Trump had been expected to nominate a successor to Jerome Powell, whose term ends in May - the president frequently criticised Powell for not cutting interest rates faster.

It's hoped this will end weeks of clashes in northeastern Syria. 
 
The fighting has been blamed for recent escapes from prison camps, where suspected ISIS fighters and their families are being kept, under the guard of the Kurds.
 
So will this deal help secure the camps? And, as Washington throws its support behind the Syrian government, is this a sign that the US has abandoned the Kurds?

nTJUcqHpHW0,Russia says it will pause attacks on Kyiv until Sunday | BBC News,"Ukraine saw a relatively quiet night after Donald Trump said his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin had agreed not to attack Kyiv and ""various towns"" during a cold snap.
 
The Kremlin confirmed it had agreed to cease attacks on Kyiv until Sunday to ""create favourable conditions"" for peace talks.
 
While the US president did not say when the pause would begin, air raid alerts sounded in just eight Ukrainian regions overnight into Friday, with two minor injuries recorded in Zaporizhzhia.
 
Temperatures in the capital, Kyiv, are due to plummet to -24C (-11F) over the coming days. Russia has recently intensified attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, as it has during cold periods since its invasion began.
 
Ukrainian officials had been expecting a major attack this weekend ahead of the current cold spell - if that does not take place, it could mark a significant step in US-led efforts to bring the war to a close.

Tech Now look into how the thing of science fiction has suddenly become a thing of today, how AI plays its part and how it feels to be in a driverless pod.

wN44xqihChg,More than three million pages from Epstein files released | BBC News,"The US justice department has released more than three million pages of documents related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

More than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images are included in the latest batch, and their release comes six weeks after a deadline mandated in a law signed by President Donald Trump.

The justice department previously blamed not meeting the deadline on having to review millions of materials to redact anything that could risk identifying victims.

Thousands of pages have already been made public in prior releases, which have included photographs with high-profile people, text messages and emails.

There is no suggestion that appearing in the documents implies any wrongdoing, and many people who have featured in previous releases have denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.

lGz0EHMzEEs,Security concerns for prisons holding IS fighters | BBC News,"Following the downfall of the so-called Islamic State in Syria, Kurdish-run prisons hold about 8,000 suspected IS fighters and around 34,000 of their family members in camps.
 
But there is growing instability in the region as the central government in Damascus wants to extend its control across all of Syria, including the Kurdish autonomous region in the north-east.
 
In the past two weeks, government troops have pushed the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces out of resource-rich areas they have controlled for a decade – since defeating IS.
 
The BBC's Orla Guerin visited Roj, a camp holding the wives and children of suspected IS fighters near the Turkish and Iraqi borders.

Q2ztueoyrdY,Venezuela approves bill to open up oil sector | BBC News,"Venezuela's National Assembly has approved a reform of the country's hydrocarbons law that will allow private companies, including foreign firms, more autonomy in the country's lucrative oil sector.
 
Once the law is signed off by the country's interim president, it is expected to pave the way for more foreign investment in the oil industry.
 
US President Donald Trump has been pushing US oil companies to invest in Venezuela's vast oil reserves, despite decades of mismanagement, under-investment and a still uncertain political climate.
 
However, one of the barriers for investors had been the existing framework that gave the state oil company PDVSA majority control over operating oil projects.
 
Shortly after Venezuelan MPs signed the law, the US eased its sanctions on the country's oil industry giving US companies more ability to operate in Venezuela.
 
The assembly, dominated by lawmakers who are allies of former president Nicolás Maduro, passed the bill with the backing of interim President Delcy Rodríguez, who assumed office after Maduro was seized in a US military operation earlier this month.

RTvwzusKXPo,How drilling the 'Doomsday Glacier' could save our cities from climate crisis | Global News Podcast,"British and South Korean scientists are drilling through the Thwaites glacier, in one of the most remote parts of Antarctica, to understand why and how it is melting. 
 
Thwaites is in danger of collapsing due to climate change, and if that happens it could lead to higher global sea levels, and flooding in the world's biggest coastal cities.
 
We spoke to the BBC's climate editor, Justin Rowlatt - one of the few journalists to have visited the Thwaites glacier.

This is not about control in that sense, although it is, as well, but not in the way that we have made it out to be in a negative concept, its about control in terms of conscious creation, you take control, in that sense you take control of yourself, you become more deliberate in your manifestations, in your creations, in what you place in front of you.

9TCkrN16Hac,"Polar bears on Norwegian islands fatter and healthier despite ice loss, scientists say | BBC News","Scientists expected the opposite, but polar bears in the Norwegian Arctic islands of Svalbard have become fatter and healthier since the early 1990s.

Polar bears rely on sea ice, which is declining, as a platform from which to hunt the seals that they rely on for blubber-rich meals. 

The bears' fat reserves provide energy and insulation and allow mothers to produce rich milk for cubs.

Researchers think that Svalbard bears have adapted to recent ice loss by eating more land-based prey, including reindeer and walruses.

They wait till the Beluga wales come into the bay and swim by , then they dive down ontop of them and kill them down in the deep with there bite force crushed there skulls .

Polar bears bears in the Canadian Arctic where not “ social “ anaimals and would kill one another over territory and would never allow another polar bear to join and share its meal , a seal kill belonging to some one else was a death sentence to approach . <br><br>Now with the Beluga whale they seem to know inherently that the meal is way to big for one bear and share the meal amongst large groups of them creating new “Non family / No relations” social structures which is very fascinating .

Ut3zbcX-OsY,What does China get out of the UK prime minister's visit? | BBC Newscast,"UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has been meeting with President Xi Jinping in Beijing, the first time a sitting British PM has visited China in eight years. Although a host of trade deals were announced, including visa free entry for UK travellers, there have been fewer agreements than expected from the trip.

Adam is joined in studio by BBC deputy economics editor, Darshini David to chat about what we know so far and China correspondent, Laura Bicker who explains how the visit has been received in China.

Chris Mason also phones in to share his experience of being on the road with the PM and how the visit has gone down with MPs back home.

592FsNMA830,Trump's border tsar suggests possible drawdown in Minneapolis | BBC News,"US President Donald Trump's ""border tsar"" Tom Homan has said he is working on making ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) operations in Minneapolis ""safer, more efficient, by the book"".

In a news conference that was light on details, he says he wants ""common sense co-operation that allows us to draw down on the number of people we have here"".

He says ICE and Border Patrol officers are working in a ""challenging environment"", but insists unprofessional behaviour will ""be dealt with"".

President Trump sent Homan to the city to replace US Border Patrol chief Greg Bovino, after two protesters, Renee Good and Alex Pretti, were shot dead by federal officials in Minneapolis.

CJ1RL7xFUWM,Why is there a TikTok censorship debate? | The Global Story Podcast,"TikTok users in the US have claimed that the social media platform has been censoring content critical of the Trump administration.

Following the fatal shooting of intensive care nurse Alex Pretti, in Minnesota, users reported that they couldn’t upload or view videos related to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, otherwise known as ICE.

The Department of Homeland Security says federal agents fired in self-defence.

TikTok disputes that functionality issues were political, attributing them instead to data centre outages.

The controversy has exposed how a divided America is reacting to the shooting. 

Asma Khalid speaks to BBC Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent Marianna Spring.

ikRBVNw4tZU,Trump warns Iran “massive armada” on way and time running out for nuclear deal | BBC News,"Donald Trump has warned Iran that ""time is running out"" to negotiate a deal on its nuclear programme following the build-up of US military forces in the Gulf.

The US president said a ""massive Armada"" was ""moving quickly, with great power, enthusiasm, and purpose"" towards Iran, referring to a large US naval fleet.

In response, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the country's armed forces were ready ""with their fingers on the trigger"" to ""immediately and powerfully respond"" to any aggression by land or sea.

Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and has repeatedly denied accusations by the US and its allies that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.

Trump's latest warning follows his promise that Washington would intervene to help those involved in the brutal and unprecedented crackdown on protests in the country earlier this month.

The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) says it has confirmed the killing of more than 6,301 people, including 5,925 protesters, since the unrest began at the end of December.  HRANA says it is also investigating another 17,000 reported deaths received despite an internet shutdown after nearly three weeks.  

Another group, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned that the final toll could exceed 25,000.

xibp_lWtJVU,How China is 'owning the future' of global power | BBC Global News Podcast | BBC News,"Sir Keir Starmer travelled to Beijing to meet President Xi Jinping - the first time a British prime minister has visited the country since 2018. 
 
Starmer said he wants to achieve a ""comprehensive and consistent approach to China"". 
 
The visit comes amid controversy over China's alleged human rights abuses and security concerns over a planned Chinese 'mega-embassy' in London.
 
Starmer is the latest of a string of Western leaders to visit China - earlier this month, Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney visited Beijing and reached a new trade agreement with China, saying his country was adjusting to a ""new reality"" of a ""new world order"", in the wake of US President Trump's agenda and tariffs. 
 
While Donald Trump's trade policies have strained ties with traditional US allies, China has been fostering relationships with other countries including the UK, Canada and India.
 
We speak to our China correspondent Laura Bicker from Beijing to discuss the perks and pitfalls of trading with China.

ILbFvTU6sFA,Mum says university 'failed' son who took his own life after grade error | BBC Radio 4 World At One,"The mother of a student who took his own life after wrongly being told he could not graduate says he was ""failed"" by Glasgow University after a report highlighted serious concerns.
 
An investigation by the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education found that the university's processes posed a ""systemic risk to academic standards"".
 
Its review was carried out after the death of Ethan Brown, who should have been awarded a 2:1 degree but was incorrectly told he had not passed his course.
 
His mother, Tracy Scott, said her son was ""robbed"" of his degree, and changes must be made to ""safeguard"" current and future students.
 
Glasgow University apologised and said it fully accepted the report's recommendations.

DgvBjtjG_0M,Donald Trump warns Iran 'time is running out' for nuclear deal | BBC News,"Donald Trump has warned Iran that ""time is running out"" to negotiate a deal on its nuclear programme following the steady build-up of US military forces in the Gulf.
 
The US president said a ""massive Armada"" was ""moving quickly, with great power, enthusiasm, and purpose"" towards Iran, referring to a large US naval force.
 
In response, Iran's mission to the UN said Tehran ""stands ready for dialogue based on mutual respect and interests"", but if pushed, it wrote in all capitals, it would defend itself and ""respond like never before"".
 
Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and has repeatedly denied seeking to develop nuclear weapons.
 
Trump's latest warning to Iran's leaders follows his promise that Washington would intervene to help those involved in the brutal and unprecedented crackdown on demonstrations in the country earlier this month.

vZWNm8CQkNY,"I will speak out on misogyny, says first woman to lead Church of England | BBC News","Dame Sarah Mullally has been officially confirmed as the 106th Archbishop of Canterbury in a ceremony rich with centuries-old tradition at St Paul's Cathedral in London.
 
Her predecessor, Justin Welby, resigned following accusations he did not do enough with information he had about a prolific abuser to prevent further abuse from taking place.
 
Dame Sarah is the first woman to lead the Church of England and told the BBC she is committed to speaking out about misogyny where she sees it and it was right that there was greater scrutiny on her own record in dealing with safeguarding in the Church.
 
The ceremony to confirm Dame Sarah was a mix of religious service and legal process - for part of the ceremony, the cathedral became a courthouse where legal rites, written down in 1533 but with their origins much earlier, were enacted.

eU5XniYGbIY,Donald Trump says government will 'de-escalate' in Minnesota after Pretti shooting | BBC News,"President Donald Trump said his administration was ""going to de-escalate a little bit"" in Minnesota, after the second fatal shooting of a US citizen by federal immigration officers there.
 
""Bottom line, it was terrible. Both of them were terrible,"" he said in a Fox News interview on Tuesday.
 
In early January Renee Good was fatally shot by an immigration officer, followed by Alex Pretti, who was killed after being stopped by border agents this past weekend.
 
Pretti's death reignited local protests and public outcry across the country, and led to criticism from lawmakers in both parties.
