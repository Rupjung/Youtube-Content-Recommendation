        "text": "Dhruv bhai, please expose how FSSAI has become a joke in India when it comes to food safety. As a food technologist, I’ve worked inside the bakery premix industry and seen companies openly use banned chemicals like dicolex in vanilla cake mixes for whitening, without ever mentioning it on the label. There are products like hazelnut spreads that don’t even contain hazelnuts, yet they get approval, and inspections by food safety officers often end with bribes instead of action. If this is happening in one company, just imagine how many others are doing the same. People trust the FSSAI stamp for hygiene and safety, but the reality is full of loopholes and corruption. This is a huge issue affecting millions of Indians daily, and only your platform can bring it into the spotlight.<br><br><br>Edit ( Dicolex/Potassium Bromate/Azodicarbonamide/Titanium Dioxide/Calcium Propionate/Sodium Benzoate/Diethyl Phthalate)<br>I’ve personally witnessed how some top food laboratories in India are compromising the integrity of food safety standards. During my time working at a lab in Delhi NCR, I saw firsthand how bribes and money were influencing lab reports. Some top NABL-accredited labs are approving food companies&#39; products without even testing the samples, or sometimes they approve them after merely seeing the FSSAI standard ranges for particular parameters. In many cases, they would adjust the values to fall within the permissible limits, even if the products had dangerously high levels of contaminants like mycotoxins, algae, or other harmful substances—all to pass the tests and help the companies avoid penalties.<br>This kind of practice is rampant across the industry. Food labs in India have become a casualty of corruption, where reports are altered and safety is compromised. The same can be said for food audits, safety officers, HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points), and even the production processes themselves. Quality parameters are frequently overlooked or manipulated to meet market demands or company needs, all while public health takes a backseat. It’s a sad reality that food safety is often treated as a joke, and consumer protection gets sidelined in favor of profit.<br>The system needs serious reform, because as it stands, the trust people place in food safety and quality is being eroded by those who are supposed to uphold it. The whole structure, from lab testing to auditing, needs transparency, accountability, and stringent regulations if we are to ensure the health and safety of consumers.",

Many students were given centers 400–500 km away, and after traveling, they found their exams canceled. There were reports of system crashes, poor infrastructure, and zero accountability. This is playing with the future of millions. We need more voices to speak up and demand justice for aspirants! 🙏",
