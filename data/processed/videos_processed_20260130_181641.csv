Q2ztueoyrdY,Venezuela approves bill to open up oil sector | BBC News,"Venezuela's National Assembly has approved a reform of the country's hydrocarbons law that will allow private companies, including foreign firms, more autonomy in the country's lucrative oil sector.
 
Once the law is signed off by the country's interim president, it is expected to pave the way for more foreign investment in the oil industry.
 
US President Donald Trump has been pushing US oil companies to invest in Venezuela's vast oil reserves, despite decades of mismanagement, under-investment and a still uncertain political climate.
 
However, one of the barriers for investors had been the existing framework that gave the state oil company PDVSA majority control over operating oil projects.
 
Shortly after Venezuelan MPs signed the law, the US eased its sanctions on the country's oil industry giving US companies more ability to operate in Venezuela.
 
The assembly, dominated by lawmakers who are allies of former president Nicolás Maduro, passed the bill with the backing of interim President Delcy Rodríguez, who assumed office after Maduro was seized in a US military operation earlier this month.

RTvwzusKXPo,How drilling the 'Doomsday Glacier' could save our cities from climate crisis | Global News Podcast,"British and South Korean scientists are drilling through the Thwaites glacier, in one of the most remote parts of Antarctica, to understand why and how it is melting. 
 
Thwaites is in danger of collapsing due to climate change, and if that happens it could lead to higher global sea levels, and flooding in the world's biggest coastal cities.
 
We spoke to the BBC's climate editor, Justin Rowlatt - one of the few journalists to have visited the Thwaites glacier.

Currently global average temperatures are at 1.5°C and is expected to rise to 2°C by 2050. \r<br>The ocean current in the Atlantic (the AMOC) has slowed by 30% over the last 150 years due to Greenland ice melting and the freshwater not being able to sink which drives the ocean currents. A drastic slow down is expected by 2050, and what the current does is it brings warm water which then warms the air from the equator northward up the Atlantic toward Greenland and this then meets the cold air coming down from the arctic: if the AMOC slows and warm air is not brought up then the cold air is not stopped and is free to come down over the northern hemisphere (North America, Europe, Northern Asia), and the freezing kills crops and kills the ecosystems in the soil which makes the soil fertile for crops.\r<br>As well without heat leaving the equator, it makes it hotter for the equator regions (South America, Africa), which increases drought which also kills crops and causes soil infertility.\r<br>1.2 billion people live in areas that could be displaced by climate effects before 2050.\r<br>Four of the top five contributors to climate change (China, USA, India, Europe+UK, Russia) are planning to double emissions by 2050.\r<br>~\r<br>Knowing creates duality (either or): this/that; here/there; then/now; good/bad; right/wrong.\r<br>Knowing creates the illusion/dream of separation of being separate from everything, which is symbolised in the bible by Adam and Eve eating from the tree of knowledge and being cast out of the garden of Eden. \r<br>The natural reality is that of non-duality and there just being everything already as it naturally is regardless of the experience of knowing (even though ‘this’ is identified there is also already as well ‘that’: it is not either or - both/ all exists already), and furthermore, without the need for knowing; again symbolised by Adam and Eve being naked – the naturality and they do not know they are naked.\r<br>This is also represented in Buddhism by nirvana/liberation: no need for knowing/ the sense of self which feels the need to know; and also in Hinduism with Moksha: the divine goddess Kali cuts off the head of the sense of self that believes it is separate from everything/ the divine. \r<br>Without need there is just absolute freedom.\r<br>~\r<br>Bentinho Massaro – Become a Manifestation Powerhouse \r<br>I want you to imagine what its like to never ever receive anything again. What would that be like, to not ever receive anything again. To not have the feeling, not have the sense, that you are at the receiving end of creation. Yes, you are perceiving creation, but are you really receiving creation? What if you are not receiving creation, what if that was never the case. What if 100% of the time, you put in place exactly the things that you see. All the time, every nano second. All the billions of molecules are placed there by you. What if you are not the receiver of experiences, but the conceiver, and the giver of experiences. What if it is you that is giving creation its creation, its form. What if you’re not a mind-body walking around in a predetermined physical external reality, what if all of this is your own manifestation. \r<br>Now this may not be a completely new concept, but what might be slightly new to you is the more radical approach of seeing the fact that you have never ever ever ever received anything to begin with, you have always given yourself this moment, you’ve always given/ you’ve always created/ you’ve always decided what this moment is going to appear as, what its going to look like, and you can therefore become conscious of that once again, instead of being an unconscious creator, that then believes it’s a receiver of its own creations which its unaware of, you can step back into the creator seat, and you can be conscious, you can become more deliberate; take the reins back up. This is not about control in that sense, although it is, as well, but not in the way that we have made it out to be in a negative concept, its about control in terms of conscious creation, you take control, in that sense you take control of yourself, you become more deliberate in your manifestations, in your creations, in what you place in front of you.

9TCkrN16Hac,"Polar bears on Norwegian islands fatter and healthier despite ice loss, scientists say | BBC News","Scientists expected the opposite, but polar bears in the Norwegian Arctic islands of Svalbard have become fatter and healthier since the early 1990s.

Polar bears rely on sea ice, which is declining, as a platform from which to hunt the seals that they rely on for blubber-rich meals. 

The bears' fat reserves provide energy and insulation and allow mothers to produce rich milk for cubs.

Researchers think that Svalbard bears have adapted to recent ice loss by eating more land-based prey, including reindeer and walruses.

Ut3zbcX-OsY,What does China get out of the UK prime minister's visit? | BBC Newscast,"UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has been meeting with President Xi Jinping in Beijing, the first time a sitting British PM has visited China in eight years. Although a host of trade deals were announced, including visa free entry for UK travellers, there have been fewer agreements than expected from the trip.

Adam is joined in studio by BBC deputy economics editor, Darshini David to chat about what we know so far and China correspondent, Laura Bicker who explains how the visit has been received in China.

Chris Mason also phones in to share his experience of being on the road with the PM and how the visit has gone down with MPs back home.

In a news conference that was light on details, he says he wants ""common sense co-operation that allows us to draw down on the number of people we have here"".

He says ICE and Border Patrol officers are working in a ""challenging environment"", but insists unprofessional behaviour will ""be dealt with"".

President Trump sent Homan to the city to replace US Border Patrol chief Greg Bovino, after two protesters, Renee Good and Alex Pretti, were shot dead by federal officials in Minneapolis.

CJ1RL7xFUWM,Why is there a TikTok censorship debate? | The Global Story Podcast,"TikTok users in the US have claimed that the social media platform has been censoring content critical of the Trump administration.

Following the fatal shooting of intensive care nurse Alex Pretti, in Minnesota, users reported that they couldn’t upload or view videos related to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, otherwise known as ICE.

The Department of Homeland Security says federal agents fired in self-defence.

TikTok disputes that functionality issues were political, attributing them instead to data centre outages.

The controversy has exposed how a divided America is reacting to the shooting. 

Asma Khalid speaks to BBC Social Media Investigations Senior Correspondent Marianna Spring.

ikRBVNw4tZU,Trump warns Iran “massive armada” on way and time running out for nuclear deal | BBC News,"Donald Trump has warned Iran that ""time is running out"" to negotiate a deal on its nuclear programme following the build-up of US military forces in the Gulf.

The US president said a ""massive Armada"" was ""moving quickly, with great power, enthusiasm, and purpose"" towards Iran, referring to a large US naval fleet.

In response, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the country's armed forces were ready ""with their fingers on the trigger"" to ""immediately and powerfully respond"" to any aggression by land or sea.

Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and has repeatedly denied accusations by the US and its allies that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.

Trump's latest warning follows his promise that Washington would intervene to help those involved in the brutal and unprecedented crackdown on protests in the country earlier this month.

The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) says it has confirmed the killing of more than 6,301 people, including 5,925 protesters, since the unrest began at the end of December.  HRANA says it is also investigating another 17,000 reported deaths received despite an internet shutdown after nearly three weeks.  

Another group, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned that the final toll could exceed 25,000.

Reeta Chakrabarti presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Caroline Hawley and Sarah Smith.

xibp_lWtJVU,How China is 'owning the future' of global power | BBC Global News Podcast | BBC News,"Sir Keir Starmer travelled to Beijing to meet President Xi Jinping - the first time a British prime minister has visited the country since 2018. 
 
Starmer said he wants to achieve a ""comprehensive and consistent approach to China"". 
 
The visit comes amid controversy over China's alleged human rights abuses and security concerns over a planned Chinese 'mega-embassy' in London.
 
Starmer is the latest of a string of Western leaders to visit China - earlier this month, Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney visited Beijing and reached a new trade agreement with China, saying his country was adjusting to a ""new reality"" of a ""new world order"", in the wake of US President Trump's agenda and tariffs. 
 
While Donald Trump's trade policies have strained ties with traditional US allies, China has been fostering relationships with other countries including the UK, Canada and India.
 
We speak to our China correspondent Laura Bicker from Beijing to discuss the perks and pitfalls of trading with China.

ILbFvTU6sFA,Mum says university 'failed' son who took his own life after grade error | BBC Radio 4 World At One,"The mother of a student who took his own life after wrongly being told he could not graduate says he was ""failed"" by Glasgow University after a report highlighted serious concerns.
 
An investigation by the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education found that the university's processes posed a ""systemic risk to academic standards"".
 
Its review was carried out after the death of Ethan Brown, who should have been awarded a 2:1 degree but was incorrectly told he had not passed his course.
 
His mother, Tracy Scott, said her son was ""robbed"" of his degree, and changes must be made to ""safeguard"" current and future students.
 
Glasgow University apologised and said it fully accepted the report's recommendations.

DgvBjtjG_0M,Donald Trump warns Iran 'time is running out' for nuclear deal | BBC News,"Donald Trump has warned Iran that ""time is running out"" to negotiate a deal on its nuclear programme following the steady build-up of US military forces in the Gulf.
 
The US president said a ""massive Armada"" was ""moving quickly, with great power, enthusiasm, and purpose"" towards Iran, referring to a large US naval force.
 
In response, Iran's mission to the UN said Tehran ""stands ready for dialogue based on mutual respect and interests"", but if pushed, it wrote in all capitals, it would defend itself and ""respond like never before"".
 
Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and has repeatedly denied seeking to develop nuclear weapons.
 
Trump's latest warning to Iran's leaders follows his promise that Washington would intervene to help those involved in the brutal and unprecedented crackdown on demonstrations in the country earlier this month.

vZWNm8CQkNY,"I will speak out on misogyny, says first woman to lead Church of England | BBC News","Dame Sarah Mullally has been officially confirmed as the 106th Archbishop of Canterbury in a ceremony rich with centuries-old tradition at St Paul's Cathedral in London.
 
Her predecessor, Justin Welby, resigned following accusations he did not do enough with information he had about a prolific abuser to prevent further abuse from taking place.
 
Dame Sarah is the first woman to lead the Church of England and told the BBC she is committed to speaking out about misogyny where she sees it and it was right that there was greater scrutiny on her own record in dealing with safeguarding in the Church.
 
The ceremony to confirm Dame Sarah was a mix of religious service and legal process - for part of the ceremony, the cathedral became a courthouse where legal rites, written down in 1533 but with their origins much earlier, were enacted.

C4uELLwkXGs,Funeral held in Israel for last hostage retrieved from Gaza | BBC News,"Israel is expected to reopen the Gaza Strip's key border crossing with Egypt, now that the funeral for the last hostage retrieved from Gaza has been able to take place.

eU5XniYGbIY,Donald Trump says government will 'de-escalate' in Minnesota after Pretti shooting | BBC News,"President Donald Trump said his administration was ""going to de-escalate a little bit"" in Minnesota, after the second fatal shooting of a US citizen by federal immigration officers there.
 
""Bottom line, it was terrible. Both of them were terrible,"" he said in a Fox News interview on Tuesday.

Gbe2Kxg-KjQ,Many thousands confirmed killed in recent Iran protests | BBC News,"The scale of the killings in Iran during the brutal recent crackdown on anti-government protesters is being laid bare.  One human rights group, whose estimates have proved accurate in the past, says it has verified more than 6,000 deaths.  The Human Rights Activists News Agency says it’s investigating reports of more than 17,000 other killings.    Other estimates have put the number who have died at more than 33,000. 

Evidence is emerging of the systematic killing of protesters, who took to the streets demanding the end of Iran’s theocratic regime.  Many of those who died were shot on the streets but there are reports of protesters being killed while being treated in hospital and people disappearing after being arrested at their homes. 

Some of the protesters have been telling the BBC about what they witnessed.  Parisa, a 29-year-old woman living in Tehran, said she knew at least 13 people who had been killed since the protests over economic conditions erupted in the capital on 28 December and evolved into one of the deadliest periods of anti-government unrest in the history of the Islamic Republic.  Mehdi, 24, also from Tehran, described witnessing multiple killings of protesters at close range by security forces.

The Iranian authorities have said that more than 3,100 people were killed, while claiming that most of them were security personnel or bystanders attacked by those they described as “rioters”. 

Most international news organisations, including the BBC, are barred from reporting inside Iran. But videos showing security forces firing live ammunition at crowds have been verified by the BBC.

ymh0MN8EhYs,Will the support package for pubs from the UK Government be enough? | BBC Newscast,"Today, the chancellor has announced a package of support for pubs and music venues after the government was forced to U-turn on their plans to bump up business rates.   

BBC Business editor Simon Jack joins Adam to explain the measures, whilst political correspondent Joe Pike drops by to unpack the government’s other big announcement of the day - capping ground rents at £250 a year for leaseholders.  

Plus, the PM is on his way to Beijing. Ahead of his visit, Starmer said the UK cannot afford to ignore the economic opportunities presented by working with China. His visit comes after one of the country’s top generals was purged by the government. Our China correspondent Laura Bicker gives Adam a rundown of what to expect.

The US fleet including several guided missile destroyers are reported to be in striking range of Iranian territory.

Since the crackdown began on protestors by the Iranian regime, President Trump has given mixed signals on intervention, but is now warning of a ""big armada next to Iran. Bigger than Venezuela."" 

We speak to the BBC's Defence Correspondent Jonathan Beale about what we know about US military capabilities in the region and what could happen next.

6kkf5_YBN8w,New videos emerge from Iran as death toll continues to rise | BBC News,"The BBC has been able to speak to several Iranians in recent days, as new footage emerges of the unprecedented crackdown on protests earlier this month. 
 
The internet blackout is now patchy, after weeks where a total shutdown made it difficult to understand what was happening in the country. 
 
The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (Hrana) says it has so far confirmed the killing of at least 6,159 people in Iran since the unrest began and is investigating another 17,000 reported deaths. 
 
Iranian authorities said last week that more than 3,100 people had been killed, but that the majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by ""rioters"".
 
Most international news organisations, including the BBC, are barred from reporting inside Iran. But, videos showing security forces firing live ammunition at crowds have been verified by the BBC.
