    "description": "Venezuela's National Assembly has approved a reform of the country's hydrocarbons law that will allow private companies, including foreign firms, more autonomy in the country's lucrative oil sector.\n \nOnce the law is signed off by the country's interim president, it is expected to pave the way for more foreign investment in the oil industry.\n \nUS President Donald Trump has been pushing US oil companies to invest in Venezuela's vast oil reserves, despite decades of mismanagement, under-investment and a still uncertain political climate.\n \nHowever, one of the barriers for investors had been the existing framework that gave the state oil company PDVSA majority control over operating oil projects.\n \nShortly after Venezuelan MPs signed the law, the US eased its sanctions on the country's oil industry giving US companies more ability to operate in Venezuela.\n \nThe assembly, dominated by lawmakers who are allies of former president Nicolás Maduro, passed the bill with the backing of interim President Delcy Rodríguez, who assumed office after Maduro was seized in a US military operation earlier this month.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#Venezuela #Oil #BBCNews",

        "text": "Some scientists say that 1.3°C global average temperatures is the tipping point where the Greenland ice sheet will continue melting even if there is the stopping of human greenhouse gas emissions (mainly CO2) which hold onto and trap heat in the atmosphere instead of heat leaving into space. Currently global average temperatures are at 1.5°C and is expected to rise to 2°C by 2050. \r<br>The ocean current in the Atlantic (the AMOC) has slowed by 30% over the last 150 years due to Greenland ice melting and the freshwater not being able to sink which drives the ocean currents. A drastic slow down is expected by 2050, and what the current does is it brings warm water which then warms the air from the equator northward up the Atlantic toward Greenland and this then meets the cold air coming down from the arctic: if the AMOC slows and warm air is not brought up then the cold air is not stopped and is free to come down over the northern hemisphere (North America, Europe, Northern Asia), and the freezing kills crops and kills the ecosystems in the soil which makes the soil fertile for crops.\r<br>As well without heat leaving the equator, it makes it hotter for the equator regions (South America, Africa), which increases drought which also kills crops and causes soil infertility.\r<br>1.2 billion people live in areas that could be displaced by climate effects before 2050.\r<br>Four of the top five contributors to climate change (China, USA, India, Europe+UK, Russia) are planning to double emissions by 2050.\r<br>~\r<br>Knowing creates duality (either or): this/that; here/there; then/now; good/bad; right/wrong.\r<br>Knowing creates the illusion/dream of separation of being separate from everything, which is symbolised in the bible by Adam and Eve eating from the tree of knowledge and being cast out of the garden of Eden. \r<br>The natural reality is that of non-duality and there just being everything already as it naturally is regardless of the experience of knowing (even though ‘this’ is identified there is also already as well ‘that’: it is not either or - both/ all exists already), and furthermore, without the need for knowing; again symbolised by Adam and Eve being naked – the naturality and they do not know they are naked.\r<br>This is also represented in Buddhism by nirvana/liberation: no need for knowing/ the sense of self which feels the need to know; and also in Hinduism with Moksha: the divine goddess Kali cuts off the head of the sense of self that believes it is separate from everything/ the divine. \r<br>Without need there is just absolute freedom.\r<br>~\r<br>Bentinho Massaro – Become a Manifestation Powerhouse \r<br>I want you to imagine what its like to never ever receive anything again. What would that be like, to not ever receive anything again. To not have the feeling, not have the sense, that you are at the receiving end of creation. Yes, you are perceiving creation, but are you really receiving creation? What if you are not receiving creation, what if that was never the case. What if 100% of the time, you put in place exactly the things that you see. All the time, every nano second. All the billions of molecules are placed there by you. What if you are not the receiver of experiences, but the conceiver, and the giver of experiences. What if it is you that is giving creation its creation, its form. What if you’re not a mind-body walking around in a predetermined physical external reality, what if all of this is your own manifestation. \r<br>Now this may not be a completely new concept, but what might be slightly new to you is the more radical approach of seeing the fact that you have never ever ever ever received anything to begin with, you have always given yourself this moment, you’ve always given/ you’ve always created/ you’ve always decided what this moment is going to appear as, what its going to look like, and you can therefore become conscious of that once again, instead of being an unconscious creator, that then believes it’s a receiver of its own creations which its unaware of, you can step back into the creator seat, and you can be conscious, you can become more deliberate; take the reins back up. This is not about control in that sense, although it is, as well, but not in the way that we have made it out to be in a negative concept, its about control in terms of conscious creation, you take control, in that sense you take control of yourself, you become more deliberate in your manifestations, in your creations, in what you place in front of you. Does that make sense so far as a general context to what I am sharing",

    "description": "Donald Trump has warned Iran that \"time is running out\" to negotiate a deal on its nuclear programme following the build-up of US military forces in the Gulf.\n\nThe US president said a \"massive Armada\" was \"moving quickly, with great power, enthusiasm, and purpose\" towards Iran, referring to a large US naval fleet.\n\nIn response, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the country's armed forces were ready \"with their fingers on the trigger\" to \"immediately and powerfully respond\" to any aggression by land or sea.\n\nIran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and has repeatedly denied accusations by the US and its allies that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.\n\nTrump's latest warning follows his promise that Washington would intervene to help those involved in the brutal and unprecedented crackdown on protests in the country earlier this month.\n\nThe US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) says it has confirmed the killing of more than 6,301 people, including 5,925 protesters, since the unrest began at the end of December.  HRANA says it is also investigating another 17,000 reported deaths received despite an internet shutdown after nearly three weeks.  \n\nAnother group, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), has warned that the final toll could exceed 25,000.\n\nReeta Chakrabarti presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Caroline Hawley and Sarah Smith.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",

    "description": "Sir Keir Starmer travelled to Beijing to meet President Xi Jinping - the first time a British prime minister has visited the country since 2018. \n \nStarmer said he wants to achieve a \"comprehensive and consistent approach to China\". \n \nThe visit comes amid controversy over China's alleged human rights abuses and security concerns over a planned Chinese 'mega-embassy' in London.\n \nStarmer is the latest of a string of Western leaders to visit China - earlier this month, Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney visited Beijing and reached a new trade agreement with China, saying his country was adjusting to a \"new reality\" of a \"new world order\", in the wake of US President Trump's agenda and tariffs. \n \nWhile Donald Trump's trade policies have strained ties with traditional US allies, China has been fostering relationships with other countries including the UK, Canada and India.\n \nWe speak to our China correspondent Laura Bicker from Beijing to discuss the perks and pitfalls of trading with China. \n \nSubscribe to the Global News Podcast wherever you get your podcasts or find more episodes here: https://bbc.in/GlobalNewsPodcast\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#China #GlobalPower #BBCNews",

    "description": "The mother of a student who took his own life after wrongly being told he could not graduate says he was \"failed\" by Glasgow University after a report highlighted serious concerns.\n \nAn investigation by the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education found that the university's processes posed a \"systemic risk to academic standards\".\n \nIts review was carried out after the death of Ethan Brown, who should have been awarded a 2:1 degree but was incorrectly told he had not passed his course.\n \nHis mother, Tracy Scott, said her son was \"robbed\" of his degree, and changes must be made to \"safeguard\" current and future students.\n \nGlasgow University apologised and said it fully accepted the report's recommendations.\n \nIf you have been affected by this story, visit the BBC Action Line for support: https://www.bbc.co.uk/actionline/\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#GlasgowUniversity #Glasgow #BBCNews",

    "description": "The scale of the killings in Iran during the brutal recent crackdown on anti-government protesters is being laid bare.  One human rights group, whose estimates have proved accurate in the past, says it has verified more than 6,000 deaths.  The Human Rights Activists News Agency says it’s investigating reports of more than 17,000 other killings.    Other estimates have put the number who have died at more than 33,000. \n\nEvidence is emerging of the systematic killing of protesters, who took to the streets demanding the end of Iran’s theocratic regime.  Many of those who died were shot on the streets but there are reports of protesters being killed while being treated in hospital and people disappearing after being arrested at their homes. \n\nSome of the protesters have been telling the BBC about what they witnessed.  Parisa, a 29-year-old woman living in Tehran, said she knew at least 13 people who had been killed since the protests over economic conditions erupted in the capital on 28 December and evolved into one of the deadliest periods of anti-government unrest in the history of the Islamic Republic.  Mehdi, 24, also from Tehran, described witnessing multiple killings of protesters at close range by security forces.\n\nThe Iranian authorities have said that more than 3,100 people were killed, while claiming that most of them were security personnel or bystanders attacked by those they described as “rioters”. \n\nMost international news organisations, including the BBC, are barred from reporting inside Iran. But videos showing security forces firing live ammunition at crowds have been verified by the BBC.\n\nReeta Chakrabarti presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Caroline Hawley and Jonathan Beale. \n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",

    "description": "Today, the chancellor has announced a package of support for pubs and music venues after the government was forced to U-turn on their plans to bump up business rates.   \n\nBBC Business editor Simon Jack joins Adam to explain the measures, whilst political correspondent Joe Pike drops by to unpack the government’s other big announcement of the day - capping ground rents at £250 a year for leaseholders.  \n\nPlus, the PM is on his way to Beijing. Ahead of his visit, Starmer said the UK cannot afford to ignore the economic opportunities presented by working with China. His visit comes after one of the country’s top generals was purged by the government. Our China correspondent Laura Bicker gives Adam a rundown of what to expect.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#BBCNews",

    "description": "The BBC has been able to speak to several Iranians in recent days, as new footage emerges of the unprecedented crackdown on protests earlier this month. \n \nThe internet blackout is now patchy, after weeks where a total shutdown made it difficult to understand what was happening in the country. \n \nThe US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (Hrana) says it has so far confirmed the killing of at least 6,159 people in Iran since the unrest began and is investigating another 17,000 reported deaths. \n \nIranian authorities said last week that more than 3,100 people had been killed, but that the majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by \"rioters\".\n \nMost international news organisations, including the BBC, are barred from reporting inside Iran. But, videos showing security forces firing live ammunition at crowds have been verified by the BBC.\n\nSubscribe here: http://bit.ly/1rbfUog\n\nFor more news, analysis and features visit: www.bbc.com/news \n\n#Iran #MiddleEast #BBCNews",
